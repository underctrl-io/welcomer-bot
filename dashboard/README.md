# Dashboard

To setup the dashboard, cd into this directory and run `npm install`.

Once your dependencies are installed, you can setup your environment variables.

1. Create a `.env` file in this directory
2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` into the `.env` file
3. Replace the placeholders with your own values

Here's an example `.env` file:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=1234567890987654321
```
